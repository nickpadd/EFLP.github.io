*The model predictions of the upcoming Premier League games compared to the bookmaker odds. On the left a radar plot is visible containing the most popular bets with the model predictions in light green and the Bookmakers' predictions in dark blue. On the right side a bar plot of the model's prediction for the most probable scorelines is visible.*

The figure depicts a radar plot of the most popular bets which includes both the predicted probabilities and the probability assigned by the bookmaker as a conversion of the odds.

A more detailed view of the estimated probabilites predicted by the model in the different betting categories can be seen below:

## This Season so far 

To evaluate the ongoing season predictions of the model we created the following figure which incorporates the predictions of the model and compares them to the actual results. This is accomplished by grouping the games per month in order to be able to derive a safer view of the performance:
